> In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, **maybe you can hire the A-team**.

Y creo recordar que en algún sitio he leído algo sobre una película remake...
