> Peace forge the weak, war forge the strong. 
  Trough war, I forge my armor. 
  Trough my armor, I gain protection. 
  Trough my protection, I gain the advantage. 
  Trough the advantage, I gain power. 
  Trough power, I gain knowledge. 
  Trough knowledge, I defeat mortality.

> Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
  Through passion, I gain strength. 
  Through strength, I gain power. 
  Through power, I gain victory. 
  Through victory, my chains are broken. 
  The Force shall free me.

Ni punto de comparaci贸n con el c贸digo Jedi, vamos hombre, d贸nde va a parar.
