> I am looking forward to seeing the credit crunch version of **Monopoly**, you know, instead of getting fifteen hundred pounds from the bank you have to lend the bank fifteen hundred pounds and then everybody keeps on going around the board with nobody buying any property whatsoever 'cause they always think is going to be cheaper next time they go around.
